# Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Transparency System

## Overview

The **Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Transparency System** enhances transparency, traceability, and security across supply chain operations. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures trust, prevents counterfeiting, and improves compliance with ethical sourcing standards.

## Objectives

1. **Transparency**: Ensure real-time tracking of products across all stages.
2. **Authenticity**: Verify the legitimacy of goods using immutable blockchain records.
3. **Ethical Compliance**: Monitor adherence to sustainability and fair sourcing practices.
4. **Efficiency**: Reduce overheads with smart contracts for automated operations.

## Key Features

- **Product Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitor a product's journey with real-time updates.
- **Immutable Ledger**: Store tamper-proof records of all transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate processes like product transfers and compliance checks.
- **Stakeholder Management**: Securely manage manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based platform for easy accessibility.
- **Data Security**: Ensure privacy and security using blockchain encryption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended).
   - Install npm (comes with Node.js).
   - Ethereum node (e.g., [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)) or a test network.
2. **Tools**:
   - [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for contract deployment.
   - [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) for interacting with the blockchain.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-supply-chain-transparency.git
   cd blockchain-supply-chain-transparency
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the backend folder and install required modules:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
   - Compile and deploy contracts:
     - Using Truffle:
       ```bash
       truffle compile
       truffle migrate --network development
       ```
     - Using Hardhat:
       ```bash
       npx hardhat compile
       npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
       ```

4. **Start the Backend**
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

5. **Run the Frontend**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser.

### Sample Data Population

Run the script to populate the blockchain with sample data:
```bash
node scripts/populateBlockchain.js
```

## Usage

1. **Add a Product**:
   - Provide product name and description.
   - The blockchain records the product and assigns ownership.

2. **Transfer Ownership**:
   - Transfer product ownership to another stakeholder using their address.

3. **View Product History**:
   - View detailed product history, including all ownership transfers.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Web3.js
- **Testing**: Ganache or Ethereum test networks

## Roadmap

- [ ] Integrate QR code scanning for product tracking.
- [ ] Add support for multi-chain networks.
- [ ] Develop a mobile-friendly version.
- [ ] Implement IoT device integration for automated data capture.
