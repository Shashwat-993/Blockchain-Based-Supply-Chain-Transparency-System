   - Quality Inspector

2. **Data Structures**
   - Product
   - Shipment
   - Quality Check
   - Location

3. **Key Features**
   - Role-based access control
   - Non-reentrant function protection
   - Pausable contract functionality
   - Event logging
   - Comprehensive error handling

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supply-chain-transparency.git
cd supply-chain-transparency
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. Configure environment:
\`\`\`bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
\`\`\`

4. Compile contracts:
\`\`\`bash
npx hardhat compile
\`\`\`

5. Run tests:
\`\`\`bash
npx hardhat test
\`\`\`

## Usage

### Deploying the Contract

1. Deploy to local network:
\`\`\`bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
\`\`\`

2. Deploy to testnet:
\`\`\`bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
\`\`\`

### Interacting with the Contract

#### Creating a Product
\`\`\`javascript
const product = await supplyChain.createProduct(
    "Product Name",
    "Product Description",
    ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0"),
    "BATCH001",
    currentTimestamp,
    expiryTimestamp,
    location
);
\`\`\`

#### Creating a Shipment
\`\`\`javascript
const shipment = await supplyChain.createShipment(
    [productId1, productId2],
    receiverAddress,
    originLocation,
    destinationLocation
);
\`\`\`

#### Performing Quality Check
\`\`\`javascript
const qualityCheck = await supplyChain.performQualityCheck(
    productId,
    QualityCheckStatus.Passed,
    "Quality check notes",
    ["temperature", "humidity"],
    ["20Â°C", "65%"]
);
\`\`\`

## Testing

Run the test suite:
\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

### Test Coverage

Generate test coverage report:
\`\`\`bash
npx hardhat coverage
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access control
- Reentrancy protection
- Input validation
- Hash verification
- Batch number validation
- Price range validation
- Pausable functionality
